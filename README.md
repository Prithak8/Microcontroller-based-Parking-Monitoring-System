### This repository contains three main sub-repositories. <br>
### Namely: <br>

-Final_Arduino : Connects the arduino uno with respective sensors and NodeMcu<br>
-node_mcu : Code is intended for node mcu chip which enables wifi connection for andriod development implementation<br>
-.net: This folder contains the design and framework of monitoring system<br>
